# Report

## Implementation 

import all the required libraries

Load the Dataset using pandas function .read_csv()

Done data preprocessing 

found the total number of unique words in the corpus

splitting the data into training and testing parts using train_test_split() function.

Building the model: A bidirectional LSTM (Long short-term memory) is made up of two LSTMs, one accepting input in one direction and the other in the other. BiLSTMs effectively improve the networkâ€™s accessible information, boosting the context for the algorithm

## Result

Archived an accuracy of 97.5%

## Conclusion

We have built an LSTM spam detection model using the above steps
